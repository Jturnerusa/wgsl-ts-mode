Emacs [[https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/][tree-sitter]] support for the [[https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/wgsl.html][WebGPU Shading Language (WGSL)]] providing syntax highlighting and navigation.
* Installation
In order to use this mode, you must arrange that the [[https://github.com/szebniok/tree-sitter-wgsl/tree/master][tree-sitter-wgsl grammar]] is available.
** General
Tree-sitter grammars are unfortunately a separate concern from the emacs support. There is a [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/how-to-get-started-tree-sitter#installing-the-language-grammars][section]] on installing grammars as part of a helpful article on getting started with tree-sitter in emacs that will likely be of use.
** Nix
If you use the [[https://nixos.org][nix]] package manager, it is available as part of the ~treesit-grammars~ package that you can include among your other emacs packages with,

#+begin_src nix
treesit-grammars.with-all-grammars
#+end_src

or you can specify which grammars to include,

#+begin_src nix
(treesit-grammars.with-grammars (p: [ p.tree-sitter-wgsl ]))
#+end_src
